# Re-former

This is part of the Forms Project in The Odin Project’s Ruby on Rails Curriculum where Forms are built using nearly-pure HTML and then graduating to the usage of the helper methods that Rails provide.

## Built With

- Ruby 2.7.2
- Rails 6.1.1
- Windows subsystem Linux (Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS)

### Install

Install Ruby and Rails on your local machine.

### Setup

Open your terminal and go to the directory where you want to clone the repo.

Type $ `git clone https://github.com/vichuge/re-former` to clone the repository to your local machine.

Type $ `cd re-former` to go to the re-former directory.

Type $ `bundle install` to install the necessary gems to run the project.

Now, please run this command `rails db:migrate` to run all the migration for the database and have all tables updated and read to use.

Now your environment is ready to run the project! Type rails c (for console) or rails s (to open in the server).
Once your project is running in the server, you can open the browser and paste `http://localhost:3000/users/new` to create a new user.
After creating your first user, you can edit it in the `http://localhost:3000/users/1/edit` url path.

To stop running the server in the terminal, type `Ctrl + C` inside it.
